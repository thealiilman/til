# Using Dockerrun to Configure Containers
There is an EB-only configuration file called **Dockerrun.aws.json**. This file is used to configure single or multi-container deployments on Elastic Beanstalk.  


For a single-container deployment, Elastic Beanstalk can work with either a Dockerfile or a Dockerrun file.  
For a multi-container deployment, Elastic Beanstalk can only work with a Dockerrun file.
