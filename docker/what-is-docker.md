# What is Docker?
Docker is an **ecosystem** for creating & running containers.
Within the ecosystem, there are tools such as **Docker Compose**. These tools work together for a process called **Containerization**.

## What is Containerization?
Containerization is the process of _isolating your software from the environment_ by creating a **container** for the software.

## Why Containerize Your Software?
It ensures that your software dependencies are _kept only within the container itself_.
